# This is a simple iPod app built using React.js

## It has two sub components, buttons and display which function together in the App component to make the app work. Following are some basic functionalities of the App:

## A menu of options is provided as you can see such as Settings, Games, Music etc

## You can click and hold on the circular menu and move the mouse in a circular fashion inside the menu boundary to navigate in the iPod menu

## On clicking of the centre button you can go inside the particular menu item

## Clicking on the menu item directly from scrren also hides the main menu and opens a screen of that particular option, like settings, games etc
